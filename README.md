## Routes currently implemented

`/`, `/about`, `/accessibility`, `/commercial`, `/contact`, `/get-a-quote`, `/heritage`, `/privacy-policy`, `/residential`, `/terms`, plus `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml`.

## Design

The north-star design lives at `design-system/project/ui-kit/marketing-site.html` (a self-contained HTML/CSS prototype). The Next.js app has **not yet been re-skinned to match it** — that's Phase 3 of the consolidation plan at `content/agw/reports/cleanup-revised-execution-plan-2026-04-22.md`.

Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, motion) live in `design-system/project/colors_and_type.css` and have yet to be ported into the Next.js app.

Brand palette:

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--agw-blue` | `#0063B0` | Lapis Lazuli — signature brand |
| `--agw-celeste` | `#6CBBE8` | Blue Celeste — accents |
| `--agw-ivory` | `#F9F8F2` | Default page surface |
| `--agw-dark` | `#595953` | Shadow Gray — body text |

Typography: Playfair Display (headlines) + Poppins (UI).

## Branches
